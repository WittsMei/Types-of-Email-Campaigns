As a digital marketer, you will come across dozens of types of email campaigns that achieve different goals for your company. The way you define and name them may differ from organization to organization. However, this reading will give you an introduction to the main types of email campaigns and what they accomplish. In later materials, you will go more in-depth about each type of email.


### Real-life applications
As you are guided through the various types of email campaigns, think about emails you’ve received recently or in the past. Consider what the sender was trying to accomplish in emailing you. Did it work? Why or why not? 

Note: A large portion of email marketing is testing out different tactics to learn what works and what doesn’t. You might use all or just a few of the email types below, depending on what is most effective for your audience and marketing goals. 


### Types of email campaigns
The following are the most common types of email campaigns: 

Acquisition emails are sent out to acquire new customers before they start considering the brand. Acquisition emails fall into the awareness section of the marketing funnel because they engage potential customers. Typically, an acquisition email provides something for free such as a downloadable guide, free trial, or other educational material. 

Welcome emails are sent out to brand new customers or subscribers. The welcome email most commonly exists within the consideration stage of the marketing funnel because it encourages deeper engagement and specific actions.

Newsletters are sent to subscribers regularly. They contain news and informational content relevant to the company and of interest to subscribers. Newsletters are versatile campaigns because they can fall into several funnel stages. Newsletters fit in the consideration stage when potential customers are getting to know your brand. They are part of the conversion stage when customers have decided they like your brand and want to support it, and they fit the loyalty stage when customers keep coming back for more products and content.

Promotional emails are sent to inform subscribers of new or existing products or services. Promotional emails usually fall into the consideration and loyalty buckets of the marketing funnel because they encourage subscribers to take some kind of action.   

Retention emails are sent to a current customer with the intent of keeping them as a customer. This type of campaign fits into the loyalty portion of the funnel.


### Key takeaways
Although these common email types are trusted by industry experts, you will still need to test out different tactics to determine which types your subscribers engage with the most. Consider what you have learned here, but make sure to be adaptable when something isn’t working.
